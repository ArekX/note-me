            <h1>Organizing Notes in Groups</h1>

            <p>
                Notes can be organized by moving them into groups. A group can
                be created by clicking on the folder icon on the left side menu.
                You can nest groups by adding creating groups within groups by
                choosing "Add Group" from the menu of a group. You can also add
                notes directly into a group by choosing "Add Note" rom the
                group's menu.
            </p>

            <p>
                Existing notes can be dragged and dropped into groups. You can
                also move notes through the note's context menu or by using the
                "Move" option in the note's menu.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also tag notes by adding one or more tags when creating
                or editing a note. If you have tags you already created you can
                pick and reuse them. To see which notes are tagged with a
                specific tag, click on the tag when viewing the note, or use
                Advanced Search.
