            <p>
                You can set reminders for notes by clicking on the reminders
                either in the sidebar menu or in the top right menu of the note.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are two types of reminders: one-time reminders and
                recurring reminders. One-time reminders will send you a
                notification at the specified time. Recurring reminders will
                send you notifications at specified intervals for a set amount
                of times.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can also choose to set a one-time reminder from a predefined
                set of options like "In 5 minutes", "In 1 hour", "Tomorrow",
                etc.
