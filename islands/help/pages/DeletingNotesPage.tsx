                Notes can be deleted by clicking on the recycle bin icon in the
                note's sidebar menu or top right menu of the note you are

                Deleted notes are moved to the recycle bin and can be restored
                from there. Notes in the recycle bin are permanently deleted
                after 30 days.

                Once notes are deleted from the recycle bin they are permanently
                deleted together with their history records and cannot be
                restored.
